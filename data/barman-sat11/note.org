: ./barman-generator.py <num_cocktails> <num_ingredients> <num_shots>

In IPC SEQ-SAT domains, *the number of ingredients are fixed to 4.*

for example,

: pfile06-021.pddl

was generated via

: barman-generator.py 8 4 10

we set 

: barman-generator.py x 4 x

where x is from 61 to 101... and it stopped at 93.


however, in the last 4 problems in SEQ-SAT, it is

:              cocktail shot
: barman-generator  8 4 10
: barman-generator  9 4 11
: barman-generator 10 4 13
: barman-generator 11 4 14
: barman-generator 11 4 15


so 


: barman-generator.py x 4 x*1.3

seems appropriate.
