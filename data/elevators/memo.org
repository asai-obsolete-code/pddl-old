 -- p40_60_1

it means there are 40 floors and 60 passengers.
1 means it is the first problem of
such configuration



fast elevators connects between areas.
slow elevators moves within an area.

: AREA_SIZE: a divisor of FLOORS
: (a slow elevator covers this + 1 floors)
: (a fast elevator skips this/2-1 floors)

slow elevators

in p16_**_1 problems, it seems to be 4. (above example)
in p24_**_1 problems, it seems to be 3.
in p40_**_1 problems, it seems to be 10.
